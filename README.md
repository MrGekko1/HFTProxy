HFTProxy is a specialized networking tool designed for environments with multiple IP addresses. When there's a need to connect to a remote server, such as 111.111.1.111:8080, and you wish to utilize a secondary or specific IP address from your available range, HFTProxy seamlessly facilitates this connection for you. By acting as an intermediary, it intelligently routes your traffic through the desired local IP, ensuring both precision and flexibility in your network operations.
